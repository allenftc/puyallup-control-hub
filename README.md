##No, because the loop times on REV control hubs are cooked. 30Hz should not be the standard for a control system. Even the EV3 is faster ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
I am making the Puyallup Control Hub for fun just to see how overkill I can make a similar type of thing but for cheaper and more powerful, as well as smaller.
