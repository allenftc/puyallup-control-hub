## What it is
This is Highway Helper, an AI powered device that projects a heads up display onto a car's windshield. 
## How it will work
It will use some sort of processor (still deciding, most likely a Radxa Rock 4D), a screen, a camera (possibly stereo if I wanted), and connect to the OBD2 port to get vehicle speeds and stuff. 
## What it will do
It will mainly project speed, but I may add other helpful/fun features such as stop light detection that calculates whether to go or stop, something that tracks the order of a 4 way stop, and other interesting features. I may also try to render things it sees similarly to a Tesla which would be pretty fun. Additionally, it can also act as an audio device, and because it is connected to CAN, it can make engine noises for my electric car! The camera will also be recording as a dashcam.
## Why not use a phone
This is a lot more customizable and is really just a fun learning experience, but it also has practical benefits. It will stay in the car at all times, reducing the hassle of waiting for Bluetooth to connect or whatever. An old phone could stay in the car at all times too, but I don't trust the battery in a hot car. Also, the camera on a phone would not be in the correct place.
