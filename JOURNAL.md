I decided on the Allwinner T527 because it is super cheap at like $15 and for some reason has 8 Cortex-A55's which is like really good but I'm kind of sad that the one on LCSC doesn't have an NPU which I wanted to play with. I will have 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM which should be enough.
I started wiring the RAM this is so cooked
